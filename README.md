This project uses a BERT-based extractive question answering model trained on the Spoken-SQuAD dataset. Spoken-SQuAD is a version of the SQuAD dataset where text passages are converted to speech and then transcribed back into text using automatic speech recognition, creating realistic transcription errors.

The goal of this project is to build a question answering system that can handle these noisy, ASR-transcribed texts and still find accurate answers within them. The model was trained and evaluated to test its ability to understand and extract correct answers from imperfect spoken language data.
